## üìã Overview

**Linalg** is a comprehensive linear algebra library for the Go programming language. It provides a robust set of tools for matrix and vector operations, designed with an emphasis on performance, ease of use, and idiomatic Go practices. Currently, `linalg` focuses on foundational matrix and vector functionalities, with plans to expand into more advanced numerical computations.

### Why Linalg?

* **Pure Go Implementation**: Crafted in 100% Go, `linalg` has no external dependencies (CGO-free), ensuring simple builds and excellent portability across all Go-supported platforms.
* **Type Safety**: Leverages Go's strong type system to minimize runtime errors and enhance developer confidence.
* **Memory Efficiency**: Designed with memory-conscious patterns, particularly beneficial for operations on large matrices and vectors.
* **Developer-Friendly API**: Offers an intuitive and easy-to-understand API, making complex linear algebra operations accessible.
* **Modular Design**: Allows users to import and utilize only the necessary components, keeping applications lean.

### Core Components

* **Matrix Operations**: Functionality for creating, manipulating, and decomposing matrices.
* **Vector Operations**: A suite of tools for vector arithmetic, analysis, and transformations.

### Project Status

`linalg` is under active development. While the core functionalities are stabilizing, the API is subject to change as we introduce new features and optimizations. Community feedback and contributions are highly encouraged.

)

func main(){
  data := [][]int {
  {2, 4, 7},
  {3, 8, 2},
  {5, 9, 6},
  }

  mat, err := matrix.NewMatrix(data)
  
  if err != nil{
    panic(err)
  }

  transpose := matrix.Transpose(mat)
  det, err := matrix.Det(mat)
  
  if err != nil{
    panic(err)
  }
